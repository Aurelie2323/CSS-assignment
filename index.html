			Climate change has deeply touched the neighborhood of Canarsie in south Brooklyn-home to one of the largest Caribbean-American communities in New York City. And while most homes are nowhere near the Fresh Creek Basin, major flooding events and torrential rain still pose a enourmous burden on the community. The reason for this lies mostly in Canarsie's architecture; where homes are designed with a sloping driveway that invites floodwaters to pool into their basements. With one of the highest homeownership rates in the city at  <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/flatlands-canarsie"> 87%</a> Canarsie also has some of the highest flood insurance premiums in the State, averaging from <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/federal-flood-insurance-program-changing-and-homeowners-fear-it-will-push-them-out">$3,000 to $6,000</a> a month. And this can be incredibly problematic, given the fact that Canarsie residents are already facing housing insecurity. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The biggest unifying factor is flooding. In 2013, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released a map detailing which properties fell within the 1% annual flood chance zone. Regions that fall within this zone have a one-in-four chance of flooding within a 30 year period. Houses that fall within this flood zone are eligible for national flood insurance provided by FEMA. But after Hurricane Sandy, FEMA issued the first update to their maps in decades, suddenly placeing over 2/3 of households in the 1% chance flood zone. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But for many homeowners, insurance premiums are simply unaffordable. A 2019 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016718519301885">study</a> exploring the impact of the national flood insurance program (NFIP), detailed the how legislation passed by Congress in 2016 would phase out subsidized premiums for housing built before the program in 1968. As a result, the costs of insurance falls on the backs on homeowners. And to make matters worse, the Department of City Planning issued a rezoning order in 2013 in order for residential buildings to become to flood resistant-raising the price tag even more. If houses are not properly retrofitted, they lose access to low NFIP premiums.

			Canarsie faces some of the highest foreclosure rates in New York City, resulting from a history of predatory subprime lending during the housing crisis of 08'. One of the most common ways of passing down generational wealth for black Americans is by passing down property. These threats to housing security pose a threat to this very practice.
